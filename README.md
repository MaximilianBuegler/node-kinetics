# node-kinetics
Node.js package for transforming accelerometer and gyroscope data

# Notes
    Assumes all input data to be 2D arrays
    
    [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2],...]
    [[pitch1, roll1, yaw1]. [pitch2, roll2, yaw2],... ] (in Radians)

# Installation
    npm install kinetics --save
    
# Usage
    var kinetics = require('kinetics');
    
    var attitude=[ 0, 0, 0 ];
    
    var rot = kinetics.composeRotation(attitude[0],attitude[1],attitude[2]);
    console.log(rot);
    
// returns: [ [ 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1 ] ]
    
    attitude=[ 0, Math.PI/2, 0 ];
    
    rot = kinetics.composeRotation(attitude[0],attitude[1],attitude[2]);
    console.log(rot);
    
// returns: [ [ 0, 0, 1 ], [ 0, 1, 0 ], [ -1, 0, 0 ] ]

    var accelerometerData=[ [ 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ] ];
    var attitudeData=[ [ Math.PI/2, 0, 0 ], [ 0, Math.PI/2, 0 ], [ 0, 0, Math.PI/2 ] ];
    
    var vert = kinetics.extractVerticalComponent(accelerometerData,attitudeData);    
    console.log(vert);
    
// returns: [ -2, 4, 9 ]

    var rsig = kinetics.rotateSignal(accelerometerData,attitudeData);
    console.log(rsig);
    
// returns: [ [ 1, 3, -2 ], [ -6, 5, 4 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ] ]
